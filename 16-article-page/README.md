![What I have learned](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-What-I-have-learned.png)

This challenge was really simple! I have nothing much to add with this one except pratice and practice, which is the key for whatever you want to achieve. I'm always happy when I build a challenge with no trouble! It means I am getting comfortable with all the selectors and getting used to think as a developer.
